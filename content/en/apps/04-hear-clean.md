## Who is Owli-AI Hear-Clean for?

Owli-AI Hear-Clean is designed for people with hearing impairment and for users with combined hearing and visual impairment who want to understand spoken language better.

With live transcription in teleprompter mode, Hear-Clean helps you understand speech better, including faster conversations. If needed, content is rewritten in simplified language and delivered through clear TTS output to headset or hearing aid.

The app can be used as visual support (live text) and as acoustically optimized assistance.

## What does the app do?

Hear-Clean captures spoken language through your smartphone microphone and converts it to text in real time.

You can:

- Read conversations live (teleprompter mode)
- Simplify language in recognized content
- Listen to optimized output through clear speech synthesis

This makes fast or complex speech easier to understand and process.

## Teleprompter mode for live conversations

In teleprompter mode, recognized speech is shown immediately as readable text. Large text and clear structure help you follow conversations, talks, or appointments.

## Optimized speech output

For users with combined hearing and visual impairment, recognized text can also be simplified and output with an intelligible TTS voice.

Output can be routed through headphones, headset, or compatible hearing aids.

## Individual language profiles and simplified language

Owli-AI Hear-Clean allows different language profiles. You can define how content should be prepared for you, for example compact, clearly structured, or in simplified language.

In simplified language mode, recognized content is transformed into shorter and clearer sentences. This reduces complexity and helps process information faster.

Optionally, speech can also be transferred into another language. This can help in international conversations or during travel.

## Privacy and processing

Speech processing follows your selected settings. If an external service is used, only audio data required for conversion is transferred.

Stored settings remain on your device.
