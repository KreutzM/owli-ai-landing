## Who is Owli-AI Zoom for?

Owli-AI Zoom is designed for visually impaired users who want to better adapt their desktop workspace to individual visual needs.

Zoom combines Windows screen magnification with a practical desktop lens for work and study. In addition to TTS read-aloud under the mouse pointer, it includes a full-screen magnifier for longer focused desktop sessions.

Whether reading text, working with tables, or navigating applications, Zoom helps you perceive content more clearly.

## What does the app do?

Owli-AI Zoom magnifies selected screen areas in real time. It also provides contrast and color modes to improve visibility.

Magnification can be adjusted flexibly so you can set the zoom factor that works best for you.

## Integrated reading features

Owli-AI Zoom supports you not only with magnification but also with integrated reading features.

Text under the mouse pointer can be read automatically. Alternatively, you can click specific text sections and have them read aloud.

This helps you process content faster without fully decoding it visually. Especially for longer documents, websites, or tables, it can increase reading speed and reduce visual fatigue.

## Full-screen mode

In addition to classic lens view, a full-screen magnification mode is available. The entire screen is displayed magnified.

This mode is especially useful for longer desktop work sessions because no separate lens area must be tracked.

## Desktop work with better overview

Zoom is built for continuous desktop use. Magnification remains stable while switching programs or using different applications.

This helps you use your computer more comfortably in daily life or work.

## Platform support

Owli-AI Zoom is currently available for Windows.

A Linux version is planned to provide comparable support there as well.

## In development

Owli-AI Zoom is under active development. Planned features include:

- AI-supported analysis of screen content  
- Extended assistance features similar to the cloud assistance system  
- An integrated camera-based reading system for documents and text  
- Linux support  

These features are currently in concept and development.

## Privacy and processing

Owli-AI Zoom processes image data exclusively locally on your device. No screen data is transferred to external servers.
