## Who is Owli-AI Magnify for?

Owli-AI Magnify is designed for people with visual impairment or low vision who frequently face text and objects that are too small or have poor contrast in daily life:

- Package leaflets and invoices  
- Price labels and timetables  
- Manuals or labels in kitchen, bathroom, and household settings  

With the front camera, you can also use Owli-AI Magnify as a magnifying mirror, for example for:

- Makeup or shaving  
- Inserting contact lenses or checking your eyes  
- Tweezing eyebrows or checking beard contours  
- Inspecting facial skin areas  
- Spotting foreign objects in the eye  
- Checking teeth and spaces between teeth  
- Checking lipstick contours  
- Applying mascara and eyeliner  
- Checking split ends or hairline in the mirror  
- Applying skincare precisely  

Instead of carrying separate magnifiers, you can use your smartphone with features optimized for accessibility.

## What problems does the app solve?

Many standard magnifier apps are either too minimal or overloaded.  
Owli-AI Magnify focuses on three things:

1. **Clear magnification:** Continuous zoom with image stabilization so the view stays steady.  
2. **Better readability:** Contrast and color filters highlight text and edges, even in poor light.  
3. **Read aloud instead of straining:** Freeze, run OCR, and listen to the text via speech output.

## How Owli-AI Magnify works

1. **Open and point the camera**  
   Start Owli-AI Magnify and point the camera at text or an object you want to magnify.

2. **Magnify and adjust contrast**  
   Use pinch zoom or the slider until the size fits your needs. If the background is distracting, enable a contrast or color filter.

3. **Freeze the image**  
   Tap once to freeze the image. This lets you hold the phone comfortably and inspect details without shake.

4. **Detect and read text aloud**  
   If text is in the image, you can recognize it and play it back through speech output.

5. **Use profiles**  
   Save settings that work well for you as profiles. This allows quick switching between daily situations without reconfiguring each time.

## Privacy and processing

Owli-AI Magnify processes camera images **only locally** on your device for magnification, filters, and OCR. **No images or text are sent to a server**.

The app stores only settings and profiles on your device so you can reuse them later.
