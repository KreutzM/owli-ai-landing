abstract: >
  This paper presents AHRUS, a system that uses parametric ultrasound to make
  environmental information audible for people with visual impairment or
  blindness. Through self-demodulation, directional properties of ultrasound
  are preserved so signals can be perceived with the user's own ears. The
  contribution describes the technical setup of a prototype and initial usage
  concepts. In an initial evaluation with four participants, the system was
  tested in practice. Compared with classic flash-sonar echolocation, the
  approach shows advantages for small structures and for the stealth issue of
  smooth surfaces.
