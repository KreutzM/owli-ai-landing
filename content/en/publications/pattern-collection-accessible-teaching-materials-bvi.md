  This paper addresses the problem that graphical representations such as
  circuit diagrams, Karnaugh maps, or UML diagrams are often inaccessible for
  blind and visually impaired students in STEM education. It shows that general
  guidelines such as WCAG do not provide sufficiently concrete workflows for
  subject-specific teaching materials. As a contribution, the authors present a
  collection of five pedagogical design patterns: transformable text-first
  authoring, textual modeling for diagram generation, tactile and haptic
  workflows, auditory preparation of time series, and human-in-the-loop
  explanations. The patterns are derived from teaching practice and are
  complemented by tool recommendations and implementation examples. The goal is
  a structured methodology for multimodal teaching materials usable with screen
  readers, braille displays, tactile printing, and sonification tools. Although
  developed in computer science and electrical engineering education, the paper
  describes transferability to other diagram-centered disciplines.
